Remember Raids? Well we decided that wasn't enough! Enjoy!!

+ New zombie, the Hull. Icy, slows you down when it attacks.
+ Blood Moon, nighttime spawn rates are increased, and mobs deal 50% more damage. Your surroundings turn crimson, awash with dark moonlight. Villagers sweat like they do during a Raid, even when they sleep. You cannot sleep through the night. Nightmares are terrible...
+ Solar Eclipse, looks like nighttime when it's technically day, mobs spawn with Blood Moon rates but no damage increase. Strange things can happen during an Eclipse...

+ New weather!
    Sandstorm, only occurs in deserts. Makes it harder to see, makes you move slower, and deals damage every few seconds. You might need a couple of potions to make it through. Zombies caught in Sandstorms eventually turn into Husks. 
    Blizzard, a snow/ice biome version of the Sandstorm. Instead of damaging you, it doesn't let you regenerate health. Be careful not to take excessive damage. Zombies caught in Blizzards eventually turn into Hulls.
