'Nuff said. Good luck.

+ Rare new Nether Fortress room. 
+ Rare new generated structure set, Castles.
+ Charged Slime blocks launch the player in the opposite of whatever direction they hit it from, even stronger than a regular slime block pushed by a piston.
~ Slimes of identical size now merge when they collide. Same applies to Magma Cubes.

==OVERWORLD==
+ The Kraken. Spawns every 1000 squids or so in deep oceans, or toss a diamond for a squid to pick up.
+ Cthulhu. Spawns every 1000 krakens or so in deep oceans, or toss a diamond for a kraken to pick up.
+ Super Slime. When enough Slimes merge together, this monstrosity comes into being. When it jumps around, it destroys many blocks that are in its way. It's particularly weak to TNT, it blows up when it runs into some. When killed, it doesn't split! It instead drops charged slime blocks, regular slime blocks, and slime balls.
+ Pillager King. Spawns on the throne in Castles. Summons Illager minions.

==NETHER==
+ Demon Emperor. Spawns in the new room in Nether Fortresses.
+ Pig King. Spawns on the throne in Nether Castles. Summons Piglin minions.
+ Mega Magma. Like the Super Slime, but it's a magma cube. Leaves behind a trail of fire and lava. Drops tons of magma cream, slime balls, and blaze powder instead of splitting.

==END==
+ End Overlord. Spawns on the throne in End Castles. Summons Enderman minions.
