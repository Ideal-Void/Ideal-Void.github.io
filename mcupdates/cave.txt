Yeah, Caves and Cliffs added a lot, but perhaps some new additions are in order?

+ Crystal Caves, new underground biome with crystals of many colors jutting in every direction.
+ Crystal blocks! Find them in Crystal Caves, dye them, and use them like glowing glass! Emits as much light as a magma block.
+ Cave variations of hostile mobs evolved glowing eyes, making caving a little easier because these mobs actually emit light. Along with normal drops, they also drop a random ore, coal, stone, or cobblestone.
+ Wooden armor, in between leather and chain.
+ Stone armor, in between chain and iron protection-wise, but lasts as long as diamond. Gives you Slowness I when any piece is worn, effect does not compound.
+ New tool, the Chisel. Right click certain blocks with it to change the look.
+ New tool, Diamond Chisel. Left click chip out individual voxels from blocks, and right click to replace them if you mess up. Those voxels are stored in an infinite secret compartment in the chisel, so you don't need to worry about storage!
+ Diamond, emerald, and quartz now have raw forms like amethyst shards.
+ Amethyst shards have a refined gem form.
+ Sounds now echo in mountains and caves. Cave noises are even MORE terrifying!
+ Dense ores, break into anywhere from 2 to 10 times as many Raw Minerals. Probability becomes less and less for higher numbers (2x is a 50% chance of dropping, 3x is a 25% chance, 4x is 12.5%, 5x is 6.25%, 6x is 3.125%, 7x is 1.5625%, 8x is 0.78125%, 9x is 0.390625%, and 10x is a 0.1953125% chance of dropping. Stacks with the Fortune enchantment.)
+ Emerald tools and armor! It has been long overdue. They're just as tough as diamond.
+ New ores, Ruby, Sapphire, Topaz, Tourmaline, Onyx, and Aquamarine. Make them into blocks, tools, and armor! They're just as rare as diamonds, and just as tough.
+ Overworld ore for Quartz.
+ New geodes for all the new gems (plus diamond, emerald, and quartz).
+ Quartz tools and armor, just like the other gems.
~ Quartz Blocks now take 9 quartz, and can be uncrafted back into quartz items.
~ Magma blocks now generate around underground lava, or in lava lakes on the surface!
~ Lava buckets no longer smelt 100 items; they now smelt only 64 items.
~ Wooden armor has variants for all types of logs.
~ Gold is insanely overpowered. All tools break blocks instantly and you take no damage with the armor on, but it breaks four times faster than it already did.
~ Caves now age! It's hard to describe. Vines and mushrooms grow, teeny tiny stalagmites/stalactites form, etc.
~ Remember the eerie cave noises? Well now if you hear one, find or make some light, or apply Night Vision right away. If you're not careful, you might not make it out of that cave...
~ Emerald ore is now just as rare as diamond.
~ There is now dynamic light, like in OptiFine.
~ You can coat your face in glowstone dust to light up your surroundings as you walk.
~ Different gem armor sets give different status effects when the full set is worn. Full ruby gives Fire Resistance, quartz gives Jump Boost II and Slow Falling, diamond gives Strength III, topaz gives Haste II, emerald gives Luck VII, sapphire gives Night Vision, amethyst gives Speed IV, aquamarine gives Water Breathing and acts like it has Depth Strider III, tourmaline gives Health Boost V and Regeneration, onyx gives Resistance II.
- Removed Herobrine.
